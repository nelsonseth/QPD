A set of classes for computing the Johnson-based quantile-parameterized distributions.

Summary
-------
These quantile-parameterized equations derived from the Johnson distributions are laid out by Christopher Hadlock in his 2017 dissertation. I stumbled across these for a work-related project and I found the math and ideas fascinating. They were also very helpful for my need at the time.

I may include other functionalities, equations, and interactivity in the future as a pet project.
